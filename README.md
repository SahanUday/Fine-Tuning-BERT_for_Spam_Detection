#### Class Weight Strategy:
- **Imbalance Recognition**: The significant disparity between spam and non-spam message frequencies was identified
- **Weight Calculation**: Inverse frequency weights were computed to ensure balanced learning across classes
- **Performance Enhancement**: The weighted approach ensures the model doesn't simply bias toward the majority class
- **F1-Score Optimization**: This strategy leads to improved precision and recall for both classes

### 14. Loss Function Design - NLL Implementation
Negative Log-Likelihood loss with class weighting was implemented for optimal training:

#### NLL Loss Implementation:
The implementation focuses on optimizing probability distributions for accurate classification:

1. **Probability Distribution**: The model outputs probability distributions via LogSoftmax activation
2. **Loss Calculation**: NLL loss is implemented to penalize incorrect predictions more heavily
   - **NLL Formula**: `Loss = -log(p_correct_class)`
   - **Penalty Mechanism**: Higher penalties for confident wrong predictions

The loss function integrates the calculated class weights to ensure balanced learning despite dataset imbalance.
